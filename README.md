# Empty project

In this repo you can find an empty bash script with general funtions to check conditions before running. Those functions are:

 - Usage: prints the way the script must be executed.
 - Dependencies: checks whether the script's dependencies are installed or exists (e.g. another script that is used by this one, linux commands, etc).
 - Confirmation: ask for user confirmation to continue.
